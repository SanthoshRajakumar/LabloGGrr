<h2> Privacy Policy </h2>

<h3> Information we collect</h3>
    <p>We collect information to provide better services to our users. This includes: </p>
        <p>- Personal Information: Name, email address, phone number, etc., if you voluntarily provide it through forms (e.g., contact forms, sign-ups).</p>
        <p>- Non-Personal Information: This includes IP addresses, browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. We may collect this automatically to improve your browsing experience.</p>

<h3>How we use your information</h3>
    <p>We use the information we collect in the following ways: </p>
    <p>- To provide, operate, and maintain our website.</p>
    <p>- To improve, personalize, and expand our website’s functionality. </p>
    <p>- To communicate with you, either directly or through one of our partners, including for customer service, updates, and marketing. </p>
    <p>- To analyze how you use our website for performance monitoring. </p>


<h3>How much does it cost?</h3>
    <p>Our pricing is dependant upon the size of your inventory, and also the solutions that you’re interested in implementing. 
        For a price quote, visit our contact page and get in touch with us. </p>

<h3>How long do the inventory take to set-up?</h3>
<p>The time it takes to set-up your inventory depends on which features you wish to implement, your existing stucture of the storage, etc. 
        The inventory table and amount display on their own are typically straightforward and quick to set-up. 
        For any additional features you select, this time may increase - but it’s hard to give an exact number as it will be assessed on a case-by-case basis.</p>

        However, you can customize the what you want to be written and displayed. Get in touch with us and we will explain more!</p>
