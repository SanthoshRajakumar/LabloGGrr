    <p class="bold">How do you make the inventory tables? What do you need from me to get started?</p>
        <p>We take the list with names of all the shelfs in your inventory (in .csv format) and upload them to our system. 
        The inventory are then displayed in our system and you can start creating courses and sessions with different access. 
        We also put in a bit of manual work to make sure the storage is just as you want it!</p>

    <div class="text_blocks">
    <p class="bold">How long do the inventory take to set-up?</p>
        <p>The time it takes to set-up your inventory depends on which features you wish to implement, your existing stucture of the storage, etc. 
        The inventory table and amount display on their own are typically straightforward and quick to set-up. 
        For any additional features you select, this time may increase - but it’s hard to give an exact number as it will be assessed on a case-by-case basis.</p>

    <p class="bold">Can I customize the design of my inventory?</p>
